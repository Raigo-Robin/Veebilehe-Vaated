    <h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaguya-sama:_Love_Is_War_%E2%80%93_Ultra_Romantic">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War - Ultra Romantic</a></h2>
    <p style="font-size: x-large;">Kaguya-sama: Love is War continues to go from strength to strength, and Ultra Romantic is nearly flawless. The 2022 season sees the anime transitioning from comedy to romance, all the while still producing some of the biggest laughs of the year. As their time in high school slowly approaches its end, Miyuki and Kaguya need to quickly on their feelings or risk a lifetime of regret. While the student council president and vice-president take center stage, they are not the only characters who are caught in a whirlwind of emotions and hormones.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Made_in_Abyss">Made In Abyss: The Golden City Of The Scorching Sun</a></h2>
    <p style="font-size: x-large;">Plainly put, Made in Abyss is not for everyone. Technically, this statement holds true for every piece of art in existence; however, Kinema Citrus' show rarely shows any interest in entertaining viewers, at least not in a traditional sense. Lengthy chunks of the story revolve around torturing its young protagonists and the folks they meet in the titular Abyss, and The Golden City of the Scorching Sun contains the anime's most viscerally brutal sequences yet.

        If it clicks with someone, Made in Abyss becomes something special. The dark fantasy series is willing to go to places that most of its contemporaries are not ready to thread. That said, the anime does not rely on its shock factor to keep audiences engaged, as the series' world-building is among the best in any modern show.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Titan_(season_4)">
        Attack On Titan: The Final Season Part 2</a></h2>
    <p style="font-size: x-large;">Attack on Titan: The Final Season Part 2 is difficult to properly judge since the cour's reputation could retroactively improve or decline depending on its impending sequel's reception. Provided Part 3 sticks its landing, the anime's penultimate season will be remembered as a masterwork in crafting and maintaining nail-biting tension.

        Eren's transformation into a broken villain with genocidal aspirations has been a sight to behold, and Part 2 completes this transition while also cementing the rest of the cast's standings heading into the story's final beat.</p>
